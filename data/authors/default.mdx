I'm a Software Frontend Engineer with 3+ years of experience developing web applications using React.js / Next.js including performance, functions, integration systems, and user acceptance.

My toolkit includes React.js and Next.js, which I wield with finesse to create dynamic and responsive web experiences. I'm fluent in both Javascript and Typescript, enabling me to tackle a wide array of development challenges. When it comes to styling, I'm a fan of Tailwind CSS for its versatility and efficiency.

My experience extends to optimizing the performance of web applications, ensuring they not only meet but exceed user expectations. I specialize in honing functions, integrating systems, and conducting rigorous user acceptance testing to guarantee a seamless end-user experience.

Whether you're looking to enhance an existing project or embark on a new venture, I'm here to collaborate. Let's create web experiences that leave a lasting impression.
